TODO:
* Get rid of prepare_elements.sh - rewrite it in ant.
* Fix broken features build.xml caused by source features/plugins generation. 
Workaround for now: Copy back the original after generation is done.
* Migrate plugins with custom build.xml files to customCallbacks.
* Check naming of org.eclipse.equinox.http.jetty_1.1.0 with upstream. Version should 
not be part of the name. According to Kim Moir there are 2 equino.http.jetty plugins used in different
part of the build problem.
* Hook native compilation in the build.xml.
* Assemble tarball of the eclipse sdk.

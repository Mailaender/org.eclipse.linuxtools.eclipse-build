Detailed TODO:
* Get rid of prepare_elements.sh - rewrite it in ant.
* Fix broken features build.xml caused by source features/plugins generation. 
Workaround for now: Copy back the original after generation is done.
* Migrate plugins with custom build.xml files to customCallbacks.
* Check naming of org.eclipse.equinox.http.jetty_1.1.0 with upstream. Version should 
not be part of the name. According to Kim Moir there are 2 equino.http.jetty plugins used in different
part of the build problem.
* Hook native compilation in the build.xml.
* Assemble tarball of the eclipse sdk.

Overall PLAN:
1. Create a working build with upstream srcIncluded build.
2. Create a script to fetch sources from cvs.
3. Fix to properly build with the fetched sources.
4. Put all patches we have in Fedora srpm here so other distros can easily reuse them.
Others are welcome.

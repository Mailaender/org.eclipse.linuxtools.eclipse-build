This project should provide a simplified build for the Eclipse SDK on Linux 
distributions.  The current state is not producing a usable eclipse build. 
The completed steps are:
# Build pdebuild-ant and its dependencies in the directory bootstrap/plugins.
# Copy all the sources from the downloaded SDK to build directory, removing source plugins and features.
# Regenerate build.xml files with the bootstrapped pdebuild-ant. There are exceptions here because some of the plugins have custom build.xml files so they are just skipped.
# All plugins and features of org.eclipse.sdk built.

To test it do the following:
''run `ant -DbuildArch=YOUR_ARCH`''   

This build script is still work in progress but you should get:
* all the dependencies of pdebuild-ant in the bootstrap/plugins folder. 
* build.xml files regenerated whenever possible
* source plugins and features generated
* all.children of org.eclipse.sdk feature built
* invoke generated assemble build file - only for testing purposes for now

YOUR_ARCH should be in the way eclipse defines archs, e.g i*86 becomes x86, x86_64 is the same.
I haven't tested or looked with other archs. Any help is welcome.

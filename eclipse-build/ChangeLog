	* buildSource.sh: Generate tarballs for builder and feature.

2009-06-09  Andrew Overholt  <overholt@redhat.com>

	* patches/cleanupMaster.patch: Remove.
	* build.xml: Set eclipse.pdebuild.scripts property.  Use
	"eclipse-build-feature" feature and builder.  Use a fake home directory 
	for the builds.  Change buildID to buildId everywhere.  Remove unnecessary 
	cleanupMaster patch.  Pass property file to antRunner calls.  Build with 
	antRunner and not plain ant.  Temporarily make assemble not depend upon 
	compilelibs (for testing).  
	* build.properties: Change buildID to buildId.  Remove parallel compilation
	and flattenDependencies for now.  Don't generate API descriptions.
	Fully-expand bootclasspath (need to be more generic here).  Add
	OSGi/Minimum-1.2 BREE.  Full expand BREEs for use with antRunner (somehow 
	it doesn't expand in-file properties).

2009-06-02  Andrew Overholt  <overholt@redhat.com>

	* build.xml: Make bootstrap stuff default but allow over-riding.  Add 
	init target to do extraction of buildSource.sh-generated tarball.  Move 
	insertBuildId and applyPatches targets here.  Add package target for 
	debugging use.  Add full paths everywhere. 
	* generatebuild.xml: Use a fetched feature instead of generating one.  
	Pass buildDirectory property.
	* patches/cleanupMaster.patch: Initial checkin.  Don't include some SWT 
	fragments.
	* build.properties: Don't hard-code plugin or feature ID.  Set other 
	BREEs.  Update buildDirectory to reflect buildSource.sh output.
	* patches/eclipse-swt-buildagainstxulrunner.patch: Update to use unstable 
	XULRunner headers (dom/ files).
	* assemble.xml: Call assemble and package files for feature we're building.

'''About building the Eclipse SDK''' 

Building the Eclipse SDK is not a simple process. You can not simply download a
tarball from eclipse.org and build it. There are a lot of manual interactions 
needed.

'''About eclipse-build''' 

With eclipse-build we hope to simplify the build significantly.
Current plan is to create:
# Working ant build.
# Common place and infrastructure for storing/applying patches needed for clean build on various Linux distributions.
# Standardize the usage of system libraries.

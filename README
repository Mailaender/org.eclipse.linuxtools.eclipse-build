This project should provide a simplified build for eclipse sdk on linux distributions.
The current state is not producing a usable eclipse build. The completed steps are:
1. Build pdebuild-ant and it's dependencies in the bootstrap/plugins.
2. Copy all the sources from the downloaded SDK to build directory, removing source plugins
and features.
3. Regenerate build.xml files with the bootstrapped pdebuild-and. There are exceptions here
because some of the plugins are with custom build.xml files so they are just skipped.
4. All plugins and features of org.eclipse.sdk builded.

To test it do the following:
1. run ./fetch-sources.sh - This will download the latest milestone build 
for eclipse from the main eclipse.org site. It may be better if you just download 
eclipse-sourceBuild-srcIncluded-3.5M3.zip from a mirror near you and place it in 
the folder. If the file is found download is not performed and only unzipping is done.
2. run `ant`  - This build script is still work in progress but you should get:
	* all the dependencies of pdebuild-ant in the bootstrap/plugins folder. 
	* build.xml files regenerated whenever possible
	* source plugins and features generated
	* all.children of org.eclipse.sdk feature builded

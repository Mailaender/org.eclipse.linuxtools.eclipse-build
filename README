This project should provide a simplified build for eclipse sdk on linux distributions.
The current state is not producing a usable eclipse build. The completed steps are:
1. Build pdebuild-ant and it's dependencies in the bootstrap/plugins.
2. Copy all the sources from the downloaded SDK to build directory, removing source plugins
and features.
3. Regenerate build.xml files with the bootstrapped pdebuild-and. There are exceptions here
because some of the plugins are with custom build.xml files so they are just skipped.
4. All plugins and features of org.eclipse.sdk builded.

To test it do the following:
run `ant -DbuildArch=YOUR_ARCH`  - This build script is still work in progress but you should get:
	* all the dependencies of pdebuild-ant in the bootstrap/plugins folder. 
	* build.xml files regenerated whenever possible
	* source plugins and features generated
	* all.children of org.eclipse.sdk feature builded
	* invoke generated assemble build file - only for testing purposes for now

YOUR_ARCH should be in the way eclipse defines archs, e.g i*86 becomes x86, x86_64 is the same.
I haven't tested or looked with other archs. Any help is welcome.

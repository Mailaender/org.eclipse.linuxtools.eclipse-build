*** About building Eclipse ***

Building Eclipse is not a simple process. You can not simply download a tarball from eclipse.org and
build it. There are a lot of manual interactions needed.

*** About eclipse-build ***

With eclipse-build we hope to simplify the build significantly.
Current plan is to create:
1. Working ant build.
2. Common place and infrastructure for storing/applying patches needed for clean build 
on various linux distributions.
3. Standartize the usage of system libraries.

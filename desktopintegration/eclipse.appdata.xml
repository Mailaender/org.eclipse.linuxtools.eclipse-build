 <summary>Powerful and extensible IDE</summary>
 <description>
  <p>The Eclipse platform is designed for building integrated development
environments (IDEs), server-side applications, desktop applications, and
everything in between.</p>
  <p>It is the base of all IDE plugins but doesn't include any. However, 
  the true power of Eclipse lies in extensions and combining them, such as:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>JDT, which is required to use Eclipse for Java development</li>
   <li>PDE, which is required for developing Eclipse plug-ins</li>
   <li>Mylyn - a great context tool hiding unnecessary piece of UI, thus making coding much faster</li>
   <li>CDT - adding support for C/C++ language</li>
   <li>EMF - powerful modeling support</li>
   <li>Git/SVN/CVS integrations</li>
  </ul>
